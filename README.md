## Disclaimer

I am pretty new to shader programming, so the source may not be optimal. Contributions are welcome! :)
I tested the shader on Windows, Mac OS, iPad Pro 9.7 and iPhone 7.


## Usage

Attach the DisplacementBehaviour to your main camera and set up a noise and water texture as behaviour property (the sample ships with sample textures).
Limit the water effect to a certain scene area by adding planes to the built-in Water layer.
Everything else is set up programmatically by script.


## Implementation

I am currently writing a tutorial about the details. Stay tuned :)


## Contact

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions. In case you are going to use this shader within some application, I'd be happy to hear about :)
